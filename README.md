# Overview
In an effort of creating reproducible and transparent science, my goal is to share data repositories (through FigShare) and corresponding analysis/statistical code (usually written in R) so that other physiologists and critical care researchers can use this work as resources. Feel free to get in touch about the code and the resources I have available here.

### Introduction
Hi, I'm Jordan Bird. ðŸ‘‹ I'm current a 3rd year PhD student with the [VGH ICU Research Group](https://www.cerebriresearch.ca/team/). Originally, I got involved in research doing high-altitude physiology in 3rd year undergrad looking at respiratory responses to low oxygen. Following graduation, I started learning computer science on my own in January 2020 before joining industry to work in medical imaging looking at hypoxia and ischemia in patient populations. In 2021, I went back to school to complete a MSc in respiratory physiology using medical imaging while continuing to work in industry doing medical imaging. Along the way, I was introduced to the group at VGH and decided I wanted to do a PhD with the group following my MSc. Now, my work focuses on the physiology of cardiac arrest, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and circulatory arrest in critically ill patient populations. Collectively, my background is ***systems physiology with an emphasis on blood flow and oxygen delivery which I approach using computer science and mathematics tools.*** As my career progresses, my aim is to focus on integrating -omics approaches to systems physiology to understand the underpinnings of disease in acute brain injury. If you have interest in collaborating or want to talk about how to deal with physiology data, please do not hesitate to reach out.
