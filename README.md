### Introduction
Hi, I'm Jordan Bird. ðŸ‘‹ Currently I am a 3rd year PhD student with the Vancouver General Hospital Intensive Care Research Group (VGH ICU). My work focuses on characterizing the physiology of cardiac arrest, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and circulatory arrest in critically ill patient populations. In an effort of creating reproducible and transparent science, my goal is to share data repositories (through FigShare) and corresponding analysis/statistical code (usually written in R) so that other critical care researchers can use this work as resources. Please do not hesitate to reach out and send me an email if you havea any questions or concerns.
